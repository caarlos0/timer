---

Timer is a small CLI, similar to the `sleep` everyone already knows and love,
with a couple of extra features:

- a progress bar indicating the progression of said timer
- a timer showing how much time is left

## Usage

```sh
timer <duration>
```

It is possible to pass a time unit for `<duration>`.

Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
If no unit is passed, it defaults to seconds ("s").
