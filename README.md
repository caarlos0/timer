---

Timer is a small CLI, similar to the `sleep` everyone already knows and love,
with a couple of extra features:

- a progress bar indicating the progression of said timer
- a timer showing how much time is left
- named timers

## Usage

```sh
timer <duration>
timer -n <name> <duration>
timer -t <time>
timer -t <time> -n <name>
man timer
timer --help
```

You can use the timer in two ways:

1. **Duration-based timer** (original behavior): Specify how long to wait
2. **Time-based timer** (new feature): Specify when to stop waiting

### Duration-based timer

It is possible to pass a time unit for `<duration>`.

Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
If no unit is passed, it defaults to seconds ("s").

### Time-based timer

Use the `-t` or `--time` flag to specify a target time. The timer will count down until that time is reached.

Supported time formats:
- `14:30` - 24-hour format
- `2:30PM` or `2:30pm` - 12-hour format with AM/PM
- `14:30:45` - 24-hour format with seconds
- `2:30:45PM` or `2:30:45pm` - 12-hour format with seconds and AM/PM

Examples:
```sh
timer -t 14:30        # Timer until 2:30 PM today (or tomorrow if it's already past 2:30 PM)
timer -t 2:30PM       # Same as above, but using 12-hour format
timer -t 02:14am      # Timer until 2:14 AM (tomorrow morning)
timer -t 23:59:59     # Timer until 11:59:59 PM
```

If the specified time is in the past (earlier today), the timer will automatically target that time tomorrow.

If you want to show the start time in 24-hour format, use `--format 24h`. For
example:
```sh
timer 5s --format 24h -n Demo
timer -t 14:30 --format 24h -n "Until 2:30 PM"
```
Currently, the two formats supported by the `--format` option are:
- `kitchen`: the default, example: `9:16PM`.
- `24h`: 24-hour time format, example: `21:16`.
